# ComputerScienceFacultyWebsite

This project is an assignment I did for COMPSCI335.

This is a responsive website of faculty of science in the University of Auckland. It pulled data from the web API provided by the faculty and 
display it nicely to users on different devices. This project is coded with pure javascript, HTML5 and CSS3 without any framework.
